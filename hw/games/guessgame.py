# Create a game that creates a number and then asks the user to guess that number until they get it
# The program should reply whether the guess is too low or too high

# Starter Code

import random

guess = random.randint(0, 100)
print("Hi, I've guessed a number, can you guess it?")
userGuess = -1

while  # Complete this statement :

# OPTIONAL: think about how to handle user input that is not a number?
# Look online and try things that you find!

userGuess = int(input())

# Complete the rest of the logic, to write whether too low or too high

if userGuess == guess:
        # how to exit the game?
